- 👋 Hello, I’m Ben: currently a Graduate Material Science Engineering student at Morgan State University.

I'm a **networking and automation-focused builder** who loves designing, self-hosting, and connecting systems that actually *do useful work*. I enjoy understanding how things work end-to-end — from networking and infrastructure to workflows and AI-powered automation.

I’m interested in **self-hosted services, developer tooling, and applied AI**.

---

## 🧠 What I’m Passionate About

- Building **reliable self-hosted infrastructure**
- Automating workflows that save time and reduce manual work
- Experimenting with **local AI and RAG systems**
- Learning by *doing* — breaking things, fixing them, and improving them

---

## 🏠 Home Lab & Infrastructure

I run a personal home lab where I design, deploy, and maintain services including:

- 🎬 **Media Services**
  - Jellyfin and supporting services
- 🔁 **Automation**
  - n8n for workflow automation
  - Email sorting, customer-service-style workflows, and integrations
- 🧠 **Local AI**
  - Ollama for running LLMs locally
  - RAG agents built on custom data sources
- 🗄 **Backend & Data**
  - Self-hosted Supabase
- 🌐 **Networking & Access**
  - Cloudflare Tunnel (`cloudflared`) for secure external access
  - Custom domain routing
  - Pi-hole for network-wide ad blocking
  - PiVPN for secure remote access to my home network

This setup gives me hands-on experience with **networking, security, service orchestration, and uptime management**.

## 🤖 Automation & AI Projects

Some things I’ve built:

- 📧 **Automated Email Sorter**
  - Categorizes and routes emails using logic and AI
- 🧾 **Customer Service Workflows**
  - Automated response pipelines using n8n
- 🔍 **RAG Agents**
  - Retrieval-augmented generation over custom knowledge bases
  - Designed to answer questions from private/local data
- 🔗 **Service Integrations**
  - APIs, webhooks, and event-driven workflows

My focus is on **practical AI** — not demos, but systems that actually solve problems.
